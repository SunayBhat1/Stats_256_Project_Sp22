###### **Abstract**

In the following tutorial, we cover doubly robust estimation and key methods. We begin by detailing a brief history on the originals of doubly robust estimation and precursor methods. We then detail a precise formulation and demonstrate the mechanism by which doubly robust estimation is achieved. We further cover a few methods of interest including Augmented Inverse propensity Weighting (AIPW), Targeted maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE), and Double Machine Learning (DML). We use coding examples to illustrate the implementation and impacts of each of these methods in order to provide a clear and working understanding on doubly robust estimation methods.
