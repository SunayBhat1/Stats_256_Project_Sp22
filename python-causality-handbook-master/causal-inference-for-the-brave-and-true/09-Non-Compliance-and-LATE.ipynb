    "\n",
    "Previously, we've seen Instrumental Variables through a more traditional lens. IV was seen as some sort of natural experiment we can leverage. In contrast, modern IV practice draws a lot of insight from medical sciences. It partitions the world into 4 kinds of subjects, depending on how they respond to the instrumental variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compliers\n",
    "2. Never Takers\n",
    "3. Always Takers\n",
    "4. Defiers\n",
    "\n",
    "This naming comes from pharmaceutical science. Imagine you are conducting an experiment to test the effect of a new drug on some illness. Each subject gets assigned to a treatment: a drug or a placebo. The compliers are the subjects that stick to what was assigned to them. If they get the placebo, they take it; if they get the drug, they also take it. The never takers are those subjects that refuse to take their medicine. Even if they are assigned the new drug, they won't take it. On the other hand, the always takers are those that can somehow get the new drug even if they were assigned to the placebo. Finally, Defiers are the ones that take the treatment if assigned to the control and take the control if assigned the treatment. You can think of them as that annoying child that does the opposite of what it is told. In practice, they are not so common (the defiers, not the kids), so we will often ignore them.\n",

    "Modern IV treats the instrument as a quasi-experimental design where compliance is not perfect. By doing so, it distinguishes internally from externally valid causal effects. Just as a reminder, an internally valid effect is one we are able to identify. It is valid in that particular setting, with that particular data. In IV, it would be the treatment effect on those where the instrument changes the treatment. External validity, on the other hand, would be concerned with the predictive power of that causal effect. It would ask the question of whether we could generalize the effect we found in this sample for other populations. For example, let's say you conducted an RCT in your university to figure out if people are generous or not, when given an incentive to donate. The experiment is well designed, but you only invite economics students to participate. You then find that all of them are selfish jerks. This is an internally valid conclusion. It's valid for those data points. But can you, from that experiment, infer that humanity is selfish? That's hardly the case. So we would question whether your experiment has external validity to generalize its results. Anyway, back to IV.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it more concrete, let's consider a case where you want to boost user engagement measured by in app purchase. One way to do that, is by asking your marketing department to come up with a push you can use to engage your users. They come up with a brilliant design and very fancy user interactions. With that push, you move on to design a randomised trial. You select 10000 random customers and, for each of them, you assign the push with 50% probability. However, when you execute the test, you notice that some customers who were assigned to receive the push are not receiving it. When you talk to the engineers, they say that it is because they probably have an older phone that doesn't support the kind of push the marketing team designed. \n",
    "\n",
    "At first, you might think that this is no big deal. Instead of using treatment assigned as your treatment variable, you can just use the treatment received, right? It turns out it is not that simple. If you plot the causal graph of this whole situation, it would look something like this:"

    "Up on the causal graph, you have the push assignment. This is random by design, so nothing is causing it. Then, you have a node for if the push was delivered. Not everyone that was assigned to receive the push did it, so you have non compliance here. More specifically, you have some never takers: those that don't receive the treatment even if assigned to it. You also have reasons to suspect that this non compliance is not simply by chance. Since people with older phones are the ones that don't get the push, you can argue that income is also causing push delivery. The richer the person, the more likely it is that he or she has a nicer phone, which in turn makes it more likely that he or she will receive the push. Finally, you have the outcome variable, in app purchase. Keep in mind that we don't know income, so we can't control it. With this in mind, let's examine what would happen if we simply used the push assigned as the treatment variable and if instead we used push delivered as the treatment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case, we would estimate the causal effect by the following difference in means:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "ATE = E[Y | pushAssigned=1] - E[Y | pushAssigned=0]\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are very aware by now, this is only unbiased estimate for $E[Y_1] - E[Y_0]$ if the bias $E[Y_0|pushAssigned=0] - E[Y_0|pushAssigned=1]$ is zero. Since `pushAssigned` is random, we know that the bias is zero. Does this settle it then? Not quite. You see, if we do this, we are actually answering a different question than the one we intended to. We would be finding the **causal effect of treatment assignment**, not of the treatment itself. But are they different or can we extrapolate the causal effect of treatment assignment to the ATE? In other words, is the causal effect of treatment assignment an unbiased estimate of the ATE? \n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, it is not. Because of non compliance, the outcome of those assigned to the treatment will be pushed in the direction of the outcome of those assigned to the control. Non compliance flips the treatment unintendedly, making the treatment and control more similar in the outcome. Don't confuse this with similarity on the variables. We want treated and control to be similar on the variables. That will make them comparable. What we don't want is for them to be similar in the outcome if there is indeed a treatment effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see this, suppose first we have always takers. Some of them will be assigned to the control by chance. But those that are, will take the treatment anyway. This makes them essentially a treated group that is mixed up with the control. As a result of this mix, the causal effect will be harder to find when we have non compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](./data/img/late/always_takers.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "By the same reasoning, never takers will make those assigned to the treatment look a little bit like the untreated, because they don't take the treatment even if assigned to it. In this sense, **the causal effect of treatment assignment is biased towards zero** because non compliance shrinks the detectable impact. Another way to see this is to imagine an extreme case. Let's say that non compliance is really high. Treatment assignment says nothing about treatment received. Treatment received is purely random in this case. In IV language, that would be saying we have a very weak 1st stage. Using `Z` to denote the treatment assignment, we would have that\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "E[Y|Z=1] - E[Y|Z=0] = 0\n",
    "$\n",

    "There would be no more causal link of treatment assignment to the outcome. Z would be just a meaningless random variable floating there. "

In modern IV, we see the instrument as starting a causal chain: Z causes T which causes Y. In this context, the exclusion restriction means that Z does not cause Y, unless by its effect on T. The 1st stage is now viewed as the causal effect of Z on T.
